  üö® Critical Architectural Gaps

  1. Transitive Dependencies (CRITICAL)

  - Impact: Module compilation cannot achieve functional parity
  - Location: Missing equivalent to Pact.Core.TransitiveDependencies.hs
  - Effort: 2-3 weeks of focused development

  üéØ Summary Assessment

  Overall Progress: ~75% Complete

  The Rust migration demonstrates excellent architectural foundations with modern, performance-optimized implementations. The core infrastructure (lexing, parsing, AST, basic compilation) is superior to the Haskell version in many aspects.

  Key Strengths:
  - Solid foundation with all 28 crates working
  - Modern architecture leveraging Rust's advantages
  - Performance potential through zero-cost abstractions
  - Type safety improvements over Haskell

  Critical Needs:
  - Complete transitive dependencies - Highest priority gap
  - Finish builtin system - Required for execution parity
  - Enable LSP/Server - Essential for production use
  - Integration work - Wire all components together

  The migration is in an excellent position to achieve full parity with 10-12 weeks of focused development on the identified gaps.
