# Pact Rust Migration - Feature Parity Plan

**Date**: December 2024 (Updated)  
**Current Status**: ~75% Complete  
**Target**: 100% Feature Parity with Haskell Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan to achieve feature parity between the Rust migration and the Haskell implementation of Pact 5. **Recent analysis discovered that transitive dependencies ARE implemented in Rust**, significantly changing the priority order. The main blockers are now CEK compilation errors and missing builtin functions. The plan outlines revised tasks organized into 4 phases over approximately 12-16 weeks.

## Critical Architectural Gaps

### 1. CEK Compilation Errors (URGENT)
- **Issue**: 117 compilation errors in pact-cek due to inconsistent error types
- **Impact**: Blocks LSP server, HTTP server, and full evaluation functionality
- **Effort**: 1 week

### 2. Complete Builtin System (HIGH)
- **Missing**: 21 of 137 builtin functions not implemented (116 complete)
- **Impact**: Many Pact programs cannot execute
- **Effort**: 3-4 weeks

### 3. LSP and Server Infrastructure (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Components disabled due to CEK compilation errors
- **Impact**: Cannot integrate with development tools or blockchain
- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks after CEK fixes

### 4. Capability System Integration (MEDIUM)
- **Missing**: Full integration with CEK evaluator
- **Impact**: Security model not fully operational
- **Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Transitive Dependencies
- **Status**: Algorithm IS implemented in pact-modules crate
- **Next**: Integration with compilation pipeline needed

## Implementation Guidelines

### Transitive Dependencies Implementation

The new `pact-dependencies` crate should follow this structure:

```rust
// Core algorithm matching Haskell
pub fn get_all_transitive_dependencies(
    module: &Module,
    initial_deps: HashSet<ModuleName>,
    all_loaded: &HashMap<FullyQualifiedName, EvalDef>,
    gas_env: &GasEnv,
) -> Result<HashMap<FullyQualifiedName, EvalDef>, PactError> {
    // 1. Initialize working set with module's own definitions
    // 2. Iterate through working set
    // 3. Extract dependencies from each definition's AST
    // 4. Add new dependencies to both working and result sets
    // 5. Continue until working set is empty
    // 6. Charge gas for all operations
}
```

### Builtin Registration Pattern

Follow the established pattern in `pact-cek/src/builtin/`:

```rust
pub fn register_arithmetic_builtins(env: &mut BuiltinEnv) -> Result<(), PactError> {
    env.register_builtin(
        CoreBuiltin::CoreAdd,
        2, // arity
        |args, env, cont| {
            // Implementation matching Haskell semantics
        }
    )?;
    // Continue for all builtins...
}
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Each component should have comprehensive unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Port all Haskell integration tests
3. **Property Tests**: Use `proptest` for critical algorithms
4. **Benchmarks**: Compare performance against Haskell baseline

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Parity**: All Haskell tests pass on Rust implementation
2. **Performance**: Rust implementation is ‚â• 2x faster on key benchmarks
3. **Memory Usage**: Rust uses ‚â§ 50% memory compared to Haskell
4. **Developer Experience**: LSP and REPL achieve feature parity
5. **Production Readiness**: Successfully deploys to Kadena blockchain

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Incremental Migration**: Each phase delivers working functionality
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain serialization compatibility
3. **Extensive Testing**: Property-based testing for correctness
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking during development

## Resources Required

- **Development Team**: 2-3 senior Rust developers
- **Timeline**: 12-16 weeks for full parity (reduced due to transitive deps being complete)
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD pipeline with benchmarking
- **Testing**: Access to production Pact programs for validation

## Conclusion

**Major Discovery**: The Rust migration is in a much better position than previously assessed. The transitive dependencies algorithm IS fully implemented in the pact-modules crate, eliminating the most critical architectural gap.

The actual critical path now focuses on:
1. **Immediate**: Fix CEK compilation errors (1 week)
2. **Short-term**: Complete remaining 21 builtin functions (3-4 weeks)
3. **Medium-term**: Integration and testing (4-6 weeks)

With focused development over 12-16 weeks, the Rust implementation will achieve full feature parity and provide a superior foundation for Pact's future evolution.
