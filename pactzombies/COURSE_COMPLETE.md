## Running the Course

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd pactzombies/lessons/lesson-01-making-zombies
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Using cabal
   cabal run exe:pact -- test-simple.repl
   
   # Or using the built pact binary
   /path/to/pact test-simple.repl
   ```

3. **Progress Through Lessons**:
   - Start with Lesson 1 README
   - Complete exercises
   - Run tests to verify
   - Move to next lesson
