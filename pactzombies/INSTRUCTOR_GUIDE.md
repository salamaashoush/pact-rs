### Key Concepts to Emphasize

#### Lesson 1: Foundations
- **Module structure**: Governance, schemas, tables
- **Type safety**: Pact's type system
- **Immutability**: Blockchain principles
- **Testing**: REPL-driven development

#### Lesson 2: Game Logic

- **Randomness**: Challenges in blockchain
- **Gas considerations**: Efficient code

#### Lesson 3: Security
- **Capabilities**: Pact's security model
- **Ownership patterns**: Who can do what
- **Guard types**: Keys vs. capabilities
- **Best practices**: Security-first design

#### Lesson 4: Economics
- **Fungible tokens**: Standards and interfaces
- **Economic design**: Incentive alignment
- **DeFi patterns**: Staking, rewards, fees
- **Testing economics**: Simulation importance

#### Lesson 5: Pacts
- **Multi-step**: Different from functions
- **State management**: Yield and resume
- **Coordination**: Multi-party flows
- **Time considerations**: Timeouts and expiry

#### Lesson 6: Production
- **Cross-chain**: Kadena's architecture

- **Upgradeability**: Planning ahead
- **Deployment**: Testnet to mainnet

## Common Student Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do we need (begin-tx) and (commit-tx)?**
A: These simulate blockchain transactions. In production, each transaction is atomic - either all changes succeed or none do.

**Q: How is randomness handled in Pact?**
A: True randomness is challenging in deterministic blockchains. We use block properties and hashing for pseudo-randomness.

**Q: What's the difference between defcap and defun?**
A: Functions (defun) compute values. Capabilities (defcap) grant permissions and must be acquired before protected operations.

**Q: Why use yield/resume in pacts?**
A: They allow transactions to span multiple blocks, enable multi-party coordination, and maintain state between steps.

### Conceptual Questions

**Q: How does this compare to Ethereum/Solidity?**
A: Pact is designed for safety with formal verification, human-readable code, and no reentrancy. Kadena offers multi-chain scaling vs. Ethereum's single chain.

**Q: When should I use a pact vs. multiple functions?**
A: Use pacts when you need multi-party coordination, time delays between steps, or cross-chain operations.

**Q: How do capabilities improve security?**
A: Capabilities make permissions explicit and composable. You must acquire specific capabilities before performing protected operations.
