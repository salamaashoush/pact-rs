## Target Audience

**Primary Audience:**
- Smart contract developers new to Pact
- Blockchain developers seeking deep technical understanding
- Software architects evaluating Pact for projects
- Teams building production applications on Kadena

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic programming experience (any language)
- Understanding of blockchain concepts (helpful but not required)
- Interest in formal verification and security (beneficial)

## Version and Compatibility

- **Pact Version**: 5.0+ (latest implementation)
- **Based on**: Official Kadena Pact Haskell implementation
- **Last Updated**: 2024 (current with latest features)
- **Compatibility**: All examples tested on current Pact REPL

## Why This Book is Different

Unlike other smart contract guides, this book:
- **Goes beneath the surface** with implementation analysis
- **Provides real depth** through source code investigation
- **Offers production insights** from actual codebase study
- **Ensures accuracy** by referencing official implementation
- **Covers everything** from basics to advanced production topics

This comprehensive approach ensures you don't just learn Pact syntax, but understand the **why** behind design decisions and gain insights that come from studying a mature, production-tested smart contract platform.
