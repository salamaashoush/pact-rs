  II. Lexical Analysis and Parsing Architecture

  A. Lexer Implementation (Pact/Core/Syntax/Lexer.x)

  Technology: Alex lexer generator with comprehensive token support

  Key Token Categories:
  - Keywords: defun, defcap, defpact, module, interface, with-capability
  - Operators: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison (>, <, >=, <=, =, !=)
  - Special forms: step, step-with-rollback, bless, implements
  - Literals: Numbers, strings, booleans, with escape sequence support
  - Delimiters: Parentheses, braces, brackets for s-expression structure

  Location Tracking: Precise source location tracking via SpanInfo:
  data SpanInfo = SpanInfo
    { _liStartLine   :: !Int, _liStartColumn :: !Int
    , _liEndLine     :: !Int, _liEndColumn   :: !Int }

  B. Parser Implementation (Pact/Core/Syntax/Parser.y)

  Technology: Happy parser generator with LR parsing

  Grammar Structure:
  - Modules: (module name governance [imports] [defs])
  - Functions: (defun name [args] [body])
  - Capabilities: (defcap name [args] [@managed/@event] [body])
  - Schemas: (defschema name [fields])
  - Tables: (deftable name:{schema})

  AST Structure (Pact/Core/Syntax/ParseTree.hs):
  data Expr i
    = Var ParsedName i
    | Lam [MArg i] (NonEmpty (Expr i)) i
    | App (Expr i) [Expr i] i
    | Let LetForm (NonEmpty (Binder i)) (NonEmpty (Expr i)) i
    | List [Expr i] i | Object [(Field, Expr i)] i
    | Constant Literal i

  III. Compilation Pipeline Architecture

  A. Compilation Phases

  ParseTree → Desugar → Rename → ConstEval → ModuleHash → IR

  1. Desugaring Phase (Pact/Core/IR/Desugar.hs):
  - Syntactic sugar elimination: and, or, if, cond → core forms
  - Object binding desugaring: {:field var} → let bindings
  - Special form handling: with-capability, enforce → BuiltinForm
  - Name resolution: Local variables, qualified names, imports

  2. Constant Evaluation (Pact/Core/IR/ConstEval.hs):
  - Compile-time evaluation of defconst definitions
  - Type checking of evaluated constants
  - Gas-metered evaluation to prevent DoS during compilation

  3. Module Hashing (Pact/Core/IR/ModuleHashing.hs):
  - Cryptographic integrity: Blake2b-256 hash computation
  - Reference updates: Update all FQNs with computed hash
  - Gas charging: Size-based gas costs for hashing operations

  B. Intermediate Representation (IR)

  IR Term Structure (Pact/Core/IR/Term.hs):
  data Term name ty builtin info
    = Var name info
    | Lam (NonEmpty (Arg ty info)) (Term name ty builtin info) info
    | Let (Arg ty info) (Term name ty builtin info) (Term name ty builtin info) info
    | App (Term name ty builtin info) [Term name ty builtin info] info
    | BuiltinForm (BuiltinForm (Term name ty builtin info)) info
    | Builtin builtin info | Constant Literal info
    | Sequence (Term name ty builtin info) (Term name ty builtin info) info
    | Nullary (Term name ty builtin info) info

  Module Representation:
  data Module name ty builtin info = Module
    { _mName :: ModuleName, _mGovernance :: Governance name
    , _mDefs :: [Def name ty builtin info], _mBlessed :: Set ModuleHash
    , _mImports :: [Import], _mImplements :: [ModuleName]
    , _mHash :: ModuleHash, _mCode :: ModuleCode }

  IV. CEK Evaluator Architecture

  A. Machine State Components

  Control-Environment-Kontinuation-Handler (CEKH) Machine:

  -- Control: What's being evaluated
  data EvalTerm b i = Term (Term Name Type b i) | Value (CEKValue e b i)

  -- Environment: Runtime context
  data CEKEnv e b i = CEKEnv
    { _ceLocal :: RAList (CEKValue e b i)     -- Variable bindings
    , _cePactDb :: PactDb b i                 -- Database access
    , _ceBuiltins :: BuiltinEnv e b i         -- Native functions
    , _ceDefPactStep :: Maybe DefPactStep     -- DefPact state
    , _ceInCap :: Bool }                      -- Capability scope

  -- Kontinuation: Evaluation context
  data Cont e b i
    = Mt | Fn !(CanApply e b i) !(CEKEnv e b i) ![EvalTerm b i] ![CEKValue e b i] !(Cont e b i)
    | Args !(CEKEnv e b i) i ![EvalTerm b i] !(Cont e b i)
    | LetC !(CEKEnv e b i) i (Arg Type i) !(EvalTerm b i) !(Cont e b i)
    | CapInvokeC !(CEKEnv e b i) i (CapCont e b i) !(Cont e b i)

  B. Evaluation Rules

  Key Transition Rules:
  - Variable: <Var n, E, K, H> → <E(n), E, K, H>
  - Application: <App fn args, E, K, H> → <fn, E, Args(E,args,K), H>
  - Lambda: <Lam args body, E, K, H> → <VLamClo(args,body,E), E, K, H>
  - Let: <Let e1 e2, E, K, H> → <e1, E, LetC(E,e2,K), H>

  C. Builtin Function Integration

  Native Function Interface:
  type NativeFunction e b i
    = i -> b -> Cont e b i -> CEKErrorHandler e b i -> CEKEnv e b i
    -> [CEKValue e b i] -> EvalM e b i (EvalResult e b i)

  Gas Integration: All operations are gas-metered with asymptotic complexity bounds.

  V. Capability-Based Security System

  A. Capability Architecture

  Capability Types:
  - Unmanaged: Simple boolean authorization capabilities
  - Managed: Linear resource tracking with manager functions (@managed)
  - Event: Event emission capabilities (@event)

  Runtime State:
  data CapState name v = CapState
    { _csSlots :: [CapSlot name v]           -- Active capability stack
    , _csManaged :: Set (ManagedCap name v)  -- Installed managed caps
    , _csAutonomous :: Set (CapToken name v) -- Autonomously granted caps
    , _csCapsBeingEvaluated :: Set (CapToken name v) }

  B. Security Properties

  Access Control:
  - Principle of least privilege: Explicit capability grants required
  - Automatic cleanup: Capabilities revoked when scope ends
  - Composition safety: compose-capability for hierarchical authorization
  - Linear resource tracking: Manager functions prevent double-spending

  Guard System:
  data Guard name term
    = GKeyset KeySet                        -- Keyset-based authorization
    | GKeySetRef KeySetName                 -- Named keyset references
    | GUserGuard (UserGuard name term)      -- Custom user guards
    | GCapabilityGuard (CapabilityGuard name term)  -- Capability guards
    | GModuleGuard ModuleGuard              -- Module-level guards

  VI. Module System and Dependency Management

  A. Module Organization

  Module Structure:
  - Namespace isolation: Modules grouped by namespaces
  - Versioning: Cryptographic hash-based versioning
  - Governance: Per-module access control via keysets/capabilities
  - Interfaces: Abstract contracts for module implementations

  Import Resolution:
  data Import = Import
    { _impModuleName :: ModuleName
    , _impModuleHash :: Maybe ModuleHash    -- Version pinning
    , _impImported :: Maybe [Text] }        -- Selective imports

  B. Transitive Dependency Algorithm

  Gas-Metered BFS Algorithm:
  1. Initialize: Start with module's direct definitions
  2. Analyze: Extract FQN dependencies from term structures
  3. Expand: Breadth-first expansion of dependency closure
  4. Gas accounting: Logarithmic costs for set operations
  5. Termination: Fixed-point or gas exhaustion

  Security: Prevents DoS attacks through gas metering while ensuring complete dependency resolution.

  VII. Database and Persistence Layer

  A. Database Abstraction

  PactDb Interface:
  data PactDb b i = PactDb
    { _pdbPurity :: !Purity                 -- Read-only/write modes
    , _pdbRead :: forall k v. Domain k v b i -> k -> GasM b i (Maybe v)
    , _pdbWrite :: forall k v. WriteType -> Domain k v b i -> k -> v -> GasM b i ()
    , _pdbKeys :: forall k v. Domain k v b i -> GasM b i [k]
    , _pdbBeginTx :: ExecutionMode -> GasM b i (Maybe TxId)
    , _pdbCommitTx :: GasM b i [TxLog ByteString]
    , _pdbRollbackTx :: GasM b i () }

  B. Storage Domains

  Type-Safe Domain Separation:
  data Domain k v b i where
    DUserTables :: !TableName -> Domain RowKey RowData b i
    DKeySets :: Domain KeySetName KeySet b i
    DModules :: Domain ModuleName (ModuleData b i) b i
    DNamespaces :: Domain NamespaceName Namespace b i
    DDefPacts :: Domain DefPactId (Maybe DefPactExec) b i

  ACID Properties:
  - Atomicity: Transaction-based operations
  - Consistency: Type-safe domains prevent corruption
  - Isolation: Transaction isolation levels
  - Durability: WAL-based persistence in SQLite

  VIII. Hashing and Integrity System

  IX. Command Execution Flow for Deployed Contracts

  A. Command Structure

  Command Anatomy:
  data Command a = Command
    { _cmdPayload :: !a              -- RPC payload
    , _cmdSigs :: ![UserSig]         -- Cryptographic signatures
    , _cmdHash :: !PactHash.Hash }   -- Payload hash

  data Payload m c = Payload
    { _pPayload :: !(PactRPC c)      -- Exec or Continuation
    , _pNonce :: !Text               -- Replay protection
    , _pMeta :: !m                   -- Gas limits, chain data
    , _pSigners :: ![Signer]         -- Multi-sig support
    , _pVerifiers :: !(Maybe [Verifier ParsedVerifierProof]) }

  1. Command Reception: HTTP API endpoints (/send, /local, /poll)
  2. Verification: Signature verification, hash validation, payload parsing
  3. Environment Setup: Database access, gas limits, capability grants
  4. Evaluation: CEK machine execution with gas metering
  5. Result Generation: Transaction logs, gas consumption, events
  6. Storage: Command results stored for polling/listening
