   - Test execution framework
   - Code formatting utilities

## Exercise Structure

- **variables**: Let bindings and scoping
- **functions**: Function definition with type annotations

#### 🟡 Modules (2 exercises)
- **basic**: Module structure and organization
- **keysets**: Keyset governance and security

#### 🔴 Capabilities (2 exercises)
- **basic**: Capability fundamentals and authorization

- **operations**: CRUD operations and data management

#### 🔴 Advanced (3 exercises)
- **interfaces**: Polymorphism and code reuse
- **pacts**: Multi-step transactions
- **applications**: Real-world implementations (token, marketplace)

### Exercise Features

Each exercise includes:
- 📝 **Template file** with TODO markers
- 💡 **Progressive hints** (3-5 levels per exercise)
- 📚 **Detailed info files** with explanations
- ✅ **Automatic verification** with custom rules
- 🎯 **Solution file** (revealed after completion)

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Learning
```bash
# Start learning immediately
pactlings init my-tutorial
cd my-tutorial
pactlings list
pactlings run basics_01_expressions
```

### 2. Real-time Feedback
```bash
# Watch mode for instant verification
pactlings watch basics_01_expressions
# Edit file, save → automatic verification + celebration
```

### 3. Smart Verification
- **Syntax Checking**: Uses Pact compiler for accurate validation
- **Content Analysis**: Detects incomplete patterns (TODO markers)
- **Exercise-specific Rules**: Custom validation for each topic
- **Test Execution**: Runs any defined test commands

### 4. Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars and statistics
- Time tracking per exercise
- Completion streaks
- Topic-wise breakdown
- JSON persistence between sessions

### 5. Comprehensive Hints
- Basic conceptual explanations
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Common pattern examples
- Full solution structures when needed

## Technical Implementation

### Built with Rust
- **Performance**: Fast compilation and execution
- **Safety**: Memory-safe file operations
