# Pactlings Expanded Exercise System

## Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of all .pact and .repl files in the repository, I've created an expanded tutorial system with **42 exercises** covering the complete Pact ecosystem. The exercises are derived from real patterns found in the codebase.

## Analysis Results

### Files Analyzed
- **~70 .pact files** from examples/, pact-tests/, gasmodel/, and getting-started-with-pact/
- **~200 .repl test files** covering all built-in functions and integration tests
- **Marmalade NFT ecosystem** with policies, auctions, and ledger patterns
- **Cross-chain examples** with yield/resume and SPV verification
- **Real applications** like commercial paper, accounts, and governance systems

### Key Patterns Identified

#### From `pact-tests/pact-tests/`:
- **caps.repl**: Advanced capability patterns (managed, composed, event, autonomous)
- **defpact.repl**: Multi-step transaction patterns with continue-pact
- **yield.repl**: Cross-chain data transfer with yield/resume 
- **gov.repl**: Voting-based governance with tx-hash validation
- **namespaces.repl**: Namespace organization and qualified names

#### From `examples/`:
- **accounts.pact**: Row-level keysets, private pacts, escrow patterns
- **cp/**: Commercial paper with complex financial calculations
- **verified-accounts/**: Production-ready account management

#### From Marmalade ecosystem:
- **Token creation** with t: protocol validation
- **Policy system** for enforcing NFT rules
- **Auction contracts** using defpacts
- **Royalty distribution** mechanisms
- **Collection management** patterns

### PART IV: ORIGINAL FOUNDATION (9 exercises)
- modules, capabilities, database, interfaces, pacts, applications

## Key Innovations

### 1. Real Codebase Patterns
Every exercise is based on actual patterns from the repository:
- Guard examples from caps.repl
- Governance patterns from gov.repl  
- Defpact patterns from yield.repl and defpact.repl
- Marmalade patterns from the complete NFT ecosystem
- Time operations from time.repl tests

### 2. Progressive Complexity
Exercises build on each other with proper prerequisites:
```
basics → modules → capabilities → guards → namespaces → governance
                ↓
database → interfaces → defpacts → cross-chain → marmalade → real-world
```

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- **All major built-ins**: 100+ functions covered across exercises
- **Production patterns**: Real-world examples from actual deployments
- **Security focus**: Capabilities, guards, governance throughout
- **Cross-chain**: Full Kadena multi-chain capabilities
- **NFT ecosystem**: Complete Marmalade implementation

### 4. Enhanced Learning Features

#### Smart Templates
Each topic has custom templates that reflect real patterns:
- Guards exercises use actual guard creation patterns
- Defpacts follow yield/resume patterns from cross-chain examples
- Governance uses vote counting from gov.repl
- Marmalade follows exact token creation protocols

#### Verification Rules
Topic-specific validation ensures correct patterns:
- Defpacts must contain `(step` and `continue-pact`
- Marmalade tokens must follow `t:` protocol
- Governance must implement voting mechanisms
- Cross-chain must use `yield` and `resume`

#### Progressive Hints
Multi-level hints based on common patterns:
- Basic concept explanation
- Specific function guidance  
- Common pattern examples
- Complete solution structure

## Usage Examples

### Learning Path Examples

**DeFi Developer Track:**
